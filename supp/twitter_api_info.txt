Useful information regarding the Twitter API v1/v2 Recent Tweet Search Endpoint

- RESTful endpoint can deliver up to 100 tweets per request 
in reverse chronological order
- "Get historical" mode: requests made with a specific 
period of interest in mind (no real-time)
- Rate limits are applied based on which authentication method
you are using. For example, if you are using OAuth 1.0a User
Context, you will have one limit per time period for each set
of users' access tokens; while if you are using OAuth 2.0 Bearer
token, you will have a separate limit per time period for requests
made by your app (I believe this is what applies to us)
- The Bearer Token limit is considered completely separate from the
User Context limit. (What does this mean?)
- Recent search and filtered stream share a monthly Tweet cap limit
of 500000 tweets 

Rate Limits: (per 15 minutes)
Tweets lookup: 300 (return information about a Tweet or group of Tweets, 
specified by Tweet ID)
Users lookup: 300 (return information about  user or group of users,
specified by User ID)
Recent Search: 450 (receiving a single search query and 
responding with matching Tweets)
Filtered Stream: 450

the search API will responds with an error
