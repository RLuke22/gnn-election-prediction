# Our 2020 Election Prediction Results are Here!

We analyzed political trends on Twitter in 7 purported swing states: Arizona, Iowa, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Texas, and North Carolina. Over the last 10 days, we mined ~700,000 political tweets -- each geotagged to one of the seven above-mentioned states -- and used machine learning to assign a political label (Democratic/Republican/Neutral) to each tweet.

We aggregated the tweets from each state to determine our per-state predictions. The predictions for these states are shown in the map below:
