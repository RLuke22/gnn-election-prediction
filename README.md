### Objective
Use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on Twitter data to predict the outcome of the 2020 US Election.

### Paper List

- Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs, Hamilton et al.
  - We plan to make use of the semi-supervised GraphSAGE algorithm 
- Semi-supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks, Kipf and Welling
  - We plan to make use of the semi-supervised GCN
- Characterizing and Detecting Hateful Users on Twitter, Ribeiro et al. 
  - Useful information regarding the extraction of Twitter data using the Twitter API (constructing retweet graph)
- CS224W: Detection and Analysis of Hateful Users on Twitter, He et al.
  - Different, but related task -- a lot of useful information in this paper
- A Method for Predicting the Winner of the USA Presidential Elections using Data extracted from Twitter, Oikonomou and Tjortjis
  - Explains underlying election prediction method using sentiment analysis. Seemed to work well on the 2016 US election.
